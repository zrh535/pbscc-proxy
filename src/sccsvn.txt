map of scc commands to svn commands

** SccInfo OLD

:: get all files of workcopy and their revisions
svn info --recursive --xml D:\Home\Projects\pbscc-project
:: get files with lockby proprty set
svn propget lockby --recursive --xml D:\Home\Projects\pbscc-project

** SccInfo NEW
:: get file list and locks (a little bit long because it works with server and not with local copy)
svn list --recursive --xml --revision BASE pbscc-project
:: alternatively we can use "svn status" because it works with local copy
svn status --xml svn2
